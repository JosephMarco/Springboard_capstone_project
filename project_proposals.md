# Springboard capstone project ideas
## Introduction
An intro to my project proposal Ideas for Springboard capstone project.

## Idea 1
http://wemakeitsafer.com/
*my hopes with this idea is to analyze product recall information, correlate it across industries, and identify industries more prone to recall and why


## Idea 2
https://householdproducts.nlm.nih.gov/
*with this option, I would hope to look at health and safety information regarding common household products, and identify or predict common treatment recommendations based on similar health affects with similar ingredients

## Idea 3
https://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/download/data_distrib_main.html
*I would like to take data of known side effects (toxicology) and predict when new products contain certain ingredients, some or all of the side effects that may result, and how likely they are to result based off existing complaints if possible

## Summary
I would like feedback for which option seems most effective.
