# Springboard capstone project ideas
## Introduction
An intro to my project proposal Ideas for Springboard capstone project.

## Idea 1 (predictions and assumptions around product recalls)
http://wemakeitsafer.com/
* my hopes with this idea is to analyze product recall information, correlate it across industries, and identify industries more prone to recall and why
* Can we predict which companies are likely to have product recalls based off legacy historical amount of recalls?
* This topic is interesting to me because I currently am employed in the healtchare industry, and recalls not only affect business growth, but also eliminate brand loyalty from consumers. By being able to figure out what might be causing recalls, and how often they are cause in a particular sector or area of the business, we may be able to proactively think ahead when we are at risk of a recall. 
* This would potentially touch NLP (Natural Language Processing) since voice of the customer data will be handled in text and not numbers, making it more difficult to achieve this since NLP is outside of the data science foundations course.
* Worried about accessing this data, as it does not look easy to get to, or download.


## Idea 2 (product backorder and sales impact predictions)
https://www.kaggle.com/tiredgeek/predict-bo-trial
* This is most correlated to my current role. Product backorders == loss in business growth and thus loss in dollars contributed to a company. By being able to predict what SKUs (products) are at risk of being placed on backorder, and what type of volume in sales we would be losing, we as a company could better understand and allocate resources. If i have two products that are predicted to go on backorder, i can plan to replenish my stock to prepare and avoid this. If backorder issue is not able to be avoided, I would like to at least be able to allocate resources to the product(s) which drive the most sales, while allowing other products to be placed on backorder, thus avoiding larger loss in revenue.
* This data set comes from kaggle, I added a spin on it and included the RANDOM() function in excel for random sales, and random cost to make figures to help add to the wealth of the dataset.
* Bonus points, which SKUS have the largest backorder predictions, how can i build a long term plan to avoid this? Is there a way to reduce lead time? New manufacturing process? etc..

## Idea 3
https://householdproducts.nlm.nih.gov/
* with this option, I would hope to look at health and safety information regarding common household products, and identify or predict common treatment recommendations based on similar health affects with similar ingredients

## Summary
I would like feedback for which option seems most effective.
